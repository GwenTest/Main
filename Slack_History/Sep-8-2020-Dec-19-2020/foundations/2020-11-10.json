I don’t think we need an agenda for today’s meeting, but I’ve thought a little about what we could talk about, and I think we could start off with just talking about how things are going with the group, then discuss how we’re doing with the documents and which need more work, and then end on where we would like to be at the end of this semester\/beginning of next semester and what we need for that. Of course anything else you can think of is also welcome for discussion! I think it will be an interesting meeting, I look forward to it!",

Maybe it’s just me, but the word ‘perform’ in ‘What work did your role(s) perform that was demanding and took lots of time?’ confused me a bit, maybe ‘include’ would be more straightforward?
