After today’s meeting I think we can start working on some additional documents, namely:\n1. “How to prep a session” - I can take the lead on that as I work through prepping the first session\n2. Powerpoint template for presenters\n3. Guidelines for facilitators\n4. “How to organize a follow-up session” (e.g. a workshop, a more specific support group)\nAnd of course, we should keep on working on the initiative description\/organizational structure document too :slightly_smiling_face: If it’s becoming too much, perhaps we should think about how to prioritize, I think we can work out some of these things over the semester ^^",
