Open science is science for the 21st Century!\n\nYou can learn more about open science and how it applies to your work here: <https:\/\/psyarxiv.com\/vzjdp\/|https:\/\/psyarxiv.com\/vzjdp\/>\n\nWhat is the Open Science Student Support Group?\n\nDespite the scientific, professional, and organizational benefits of open science, it can be challenging to implement open science practices into our everyday work as students. Many students don’t know where to begin and have not been taught about open science practices in their courses.\n\nTherefore, we are starting a student support group to learn more about open science practices, and support each other in implementing these practices and the struggles of grad school in general. We’ll have biweekly sessions with brief introductions on different open science practices, such as reproducible workflows, transparent writing and preregistration, practical challenges of different difficulty levels to get students started with these practices, and plenty of time to share difficulties and best practices.\n\nHow do I join the Open Science Student Support Group?\n\nIf you are interested in joining the Open Science Student Support Group, please:\n\n1. Join our slack channel ***ADD INVITATION LINK HERE LATER***\n2. Complete this doodle poll, indicating your availability in a typical week ***ADD POLL LINK HERE LATER***\n\nMore information about specific sessions will also be promoted through the Monday Memo from the end of September.\n\nIf you have any questions, or would like to be involved in developing and organizing this group, please contact Gwen van der Wijk at <mailto:gwen.vanderwijk@ucalgary.ca|gwen.vanderwijk@ucalgary.ca>.\n\nBest regards,\nGwen van der Wijk",

Open science is science for the 21st Century!\n\nYou can learn more about open science and how it applies to your work here: "

Many students don’t know where to begin and have not been taught about open science practices in their courses.\n\nTherefore, we are starting a student support group to learn more about open science practices, and support each other in implementing these practices and the struggles of grad school in general. We’ll have biweekly sessions with brief introductions on different open science practices, such as reproducible workflows, transparent writing and preregistration, practical challenges of different difficulty levels to get students started with these practices, and plenty of time to share difficulties and best practices.\n\nHow do I join the Open Science Student Support Group?\n\nIf you are interested in joining the Open Science Student Support Group, please:\n\n1.
