It sounds like they are still in the midst of re-electing new members of the organizing group, so our post to the Facebook group is probably the best we can do right now? Hopefully we can get them more involved once the executive is elected. And Jenelle Morgan from I\/O is interested in being one of the organizers! She’ll be joining us on Monday for the meeting.",
