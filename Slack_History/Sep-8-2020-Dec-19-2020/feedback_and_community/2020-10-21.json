        "text": "Welcome to the Open Science Student Support Group’s Slack Workspace <@U01AA7U2ECA>—we’re excited to have you here!\n\nTo help you make the most of this workspace, we’d like to briefly go over how Slack works, and how we’ve organized our workspace.\n\n*Getting Started*\n\nWe encourage you to download the Slack app for desktop or mobile (or both) so that you will receive notifications from Slack. If you only use Slack in your browser you are likely to miss out on important communications from the group.\n\n*What is Slack?*\n\nSlack is a channel-based messaging platform. With Slack, people can work together more effectively and find the information they need to do their best work.\n\nA Slack workspace is <https:\/\/slack.com\/help\/articles\/360017938993-What-is-a-channel|made up of channels>, where team members can communicate and work together:\n• A channel is a single place for a team to share messages, tools, and files.\n• Team members can <https:\/\/slack.com\/help\/articles\/205239967-Join-a-channel|join> and <https:\/\/slack.com\/help\/articles\/201375146-Leave-a-channel|leave> channels as needed.\n• When messages and files are shared in public channels, you can <https:\/\/slack.com\/help\/articles\/202528808-Search-in-Slack|search your team's conversation history in Slack> to find them.\n• Discussions in channels are organized through <https:\/\/slack.com\/help\/articles\/115000769927-Use-threads-to-organize-discussions-|threads>. To start or reply to a thread click\/tap on the message you’d like to reply to and tap the Start in Thread icon, or Add a Reply button.\n\nTeam members can also Direct Message (DM) each other. DMs can be useful in a number of ways:\n• A substitute for an in-person, 1-1 conversation.\n• An easy way to catch up with a teammate.\n• A quick and simple way to ask questions.\nYou can learn more about working with Slack <https:\/\/slack.com\/intl\/en-ca\/help\/categories\/360000049043|here>.\n\n*How is our Slack workspace organized?*\n\nWe have created several public channels in our workspace, each tailored to a specific purpose:\n1. <#C01B02XP6JC|general> is the one channel that includes everyone. It is used for announcements and team-wide conversations.\n2. <#C01AND0N44U|members> is a place to introduce yourself to the group and make new connections.\n3. <#C01AGL72A2Y|resources> is a place to share Open Science resources with each other.\n4. <#C01A8QFJFHC|social> is a place for socializing with other Open Science Student Support Group members.\n\nYou can join or leave these channels at any time.\n\n*Community Guidelines*\n\nIn the interest of creating an inclusive and supportive group, you are expected to follow the University of Calgary’s <https:\/\/www.ucalgary.ca\/student-services\/student-conduct|Student Conduct policies>.",
