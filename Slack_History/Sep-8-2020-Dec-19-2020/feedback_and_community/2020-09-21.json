Although our role will likely be bigger once things get started, I think we could start preparing! I have a couple things in mind, and I’ll write them down here briefly, but I think it’s probably best to meet some time to discuss how we want to go about it :slightly_smiling_face:\n1. As we are the only unit with four people, and there are quite diverging functions included under this group, I was wondering if we might want to split into two pairs, one dealing with feedback primarily, the other with community? I think it might make it easier to organize with two people, find time to meet, etc. Just a thought though!\n2. As the foundations group has quite a lot of work on their hands, I was thinking that we might work on the setup of the foundations related to feedback &amp; community. Specifically, I think we could come up with a feedback structure to facilitate back-and-forth conversations between organizers and participants, and work on community guidelines\/setting up a structure for dealing with misconduct, complaints and conflict. \nLet me\/us know what you guys think! If you’re currently overwhelmed, I don’t think this is the most urgent, so no pressure!",
