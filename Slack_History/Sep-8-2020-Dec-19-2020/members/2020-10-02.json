Since our first session is about a week away (Friday Oct 9, 4-6pm), we thought it would be nice to get some introductions going! \n\nPlease respond to this thread if you would like to introduce yourself. We are curious about your name, preferred pronouns and program of study. You can also include a fact about yourself,  your reason for joining this group and\/or what you are hoping to learn during the meetings - or anything really! \n\nAlso, feel free to add a profile pic and update your slack profile. Thanks in advance! :) ",
