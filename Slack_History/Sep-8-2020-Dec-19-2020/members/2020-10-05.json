        "text": "Hi everyone. I'm Lorraine. I'm a 3rd year (is it the 3rd year really?) PhD student in Cognitive Psychology studying language processing and specifically the development of abstract language. I was previously a speech-language pathologist for 10 years in Calgary area schools and then a stay-at-home mom for 7 years. I have 2 boys, age 7 and 9 so I was homeschooling from March-June (not fun at all!). I love anything outdoors: running, mountain biking, hiking, camping, backpacking, and skiing (cross-country, downhill, and backcountry). I love the idea of collaboration, getting research \"out there\" (knowledge mobilization, research dissemination) and not re-inventing the wheel and I think open science supports these ideas. I look forward to the conversation.",

My name is Gwen, I prefer she\/her\/hers or they\/them\/their (my mother tongue actually has gender neutral pronouns exclusively :)). I’m a PhD student in Andrea Protzner’s lab, and am, as Lorraine, kinda amazed it’s already my third year here! I’m in the brain and cognitive program and work on neuroimaging research to improve outcomes for patients with major depressive disorder.\n\nI’m Dutch\/Hungarian, but grew up for the most part in the Netherlands. As a true Ducthie, my preferred mode of transport is biking, although I have to admit that the really cold days\/weeks here take away even my enthusiasm sometimes ^^ Recently, I’ve started to engage with some activism, currently largely focusing on promoting constructive conversation using empathic listening and building community, which is something I’m hoping this group will become as well (a community, that is). I initiated this group on open science specifically, because I noticed a gap between my wanting to do open science and what I am actually doing in my research (often not very open science, unfortunately :sweat_smile:). I hope this group will help me and others start implementing open science practices and provide an open and non-judgemental space for discussing the challenges and issues many of us face in doing research!",
