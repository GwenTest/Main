I recreationally torture myself by lifting heavy things until I physically can’t anymore, or “work out” as the kids call it these days. I am in the first year of my MSc working with Derya Sargin in the neural circuitry and behaviour lab. I study the role of orexin neurons as a neural substrate for social behaviours using Hcrt-Cre mice and was actively involved in basic neuroscience and mentorship groups throughout my undergrad. My supervisor is very supportive of a shift towards open science practices in neuroscience, which aligned with my own passion for promoting greater openness and communication in my discipline as well and is my motivation for joining this group. I am a firm believer that no matter how much we think we know, there is always something we can learn and my hope is that by being a part of this group that I will be able to both teach and learn awesome stuff about open science. \n\np.s. I am also part of the online support team for this initiative so if you have technical issues, always feel free to DM and I will be happy to help :3",
