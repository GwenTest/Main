Thanks for your thoughts <@U01AA7U4UHY> and <@U01AA7U2ECA>. <@U01AA7U2ECA> - I'm not really currently running my study, due to covid but I did get ethics after my Prosem last January. I was literally in my office on March 12th getting ready to phone participants (the whole thing is ready to run!) when our lab coordinator came in and said we are pausing the bookings of participants, and obviously I have not been able to start up since. My study (for my PhD thesis) involves testing the vocabulary and reading abilities of 6 and 8 year olds, and then running an Auditory Lexical Decision task and Word Association Task looking at the development of abstract words. We've had to pivot with Covid and one of our undergraduate students (who had an NSERC summer grant this summer) reprogrammed the Word Association Task to administer via Qualtrics and is currently running it through Zoom with 8 year olds as a pilot project (so the ethics and consent form are being used for that). If it goes well, I might run that in addition to some online testing of vocabulary and reading post-Candidacies as a modification of my original proposal (unless all of a sudden there is a miracle and we can do in person testing!).
