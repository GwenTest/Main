Basically, if you share your data could you exclude a participant. I often think about this with respect to me, when I am participating in research studies. If you were doing a survey of graduate students in psychology at U of C it would be pretty easy to identify me based on my age and even some answers to questions (i.e., do you have children).

I think your course of action likely depends on the reason you’ll be sharing your data.\n\nIf you want to share your data so other researchers can reproduce your analyses in full, then removing a participant from the open data set but not the one you used to run stats is going to create different outcomes in analyses, which defeats the reproducibility goal. So if you want to make data open for this reason, I think excluding anyone who doesn’t consent to share their data from participating is a good policy. As a participant, you can’t pick and choose what parts of the consent form you agree to, so if they don’t like one part of it then they’d have to decline consent.\n\nI’m less sure on post-hoc exclusions in cases where participants are more identifiable based on their responses. Assuming these answers are crucial to the analyses, you can’t remove them from the data set, so from a cost-benefit perspective removing the participant makes more sense.

If they’re sensitive then identifiably is a bigger concern, in which case it might be more appropriate sharing the data upon request rather than openly. If it isn’t sensitive, then the impact of the participant possibly being identified is minimal, in which case making it open probably isn’t a big deal as long as your consent form was clear about what data you’re sharing. \n\nI guess it’s also the case that if the consent form is clear and a participant consents, then they will be aware and fine that they might be more identifiable than the typical participant.
