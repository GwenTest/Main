You are right, Lorraine, there is a risk is that some participants may choose not to participate when part of the consent process is consenting to having their data posted. The participant would have to make the decision for themselves whether they accept the risk of being identified. Regardless, there should be provisions in place set by the researcher (which is also stated in the consent form) to minimize the risk of identifying any one participant, such as removing key variables (like age) that may identify any given participant in the sample. Or, a commitment to aggregate or transform certain variables to minimize risk of identifying outliers (e.g., age variable only indicates membership in one of three age categories). As Michael pointed out, this might limit reproducibility if it is a key variable in your analysis that must be removed but perhaps that is an acceptable concession if most analyses can be reproduced using the other variables. I also like Gwen's idea, I haven't seen that in a consent form yet. I wonder how much explanation there would have to be to convey these different situations to someone who is not familiar with research.",
