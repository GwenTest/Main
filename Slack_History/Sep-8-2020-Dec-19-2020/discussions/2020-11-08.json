I have never posted a preprint on that server, and I am sure you thought of these points before - but for the reporting checklist I figure you could go one of two ways 1)  fill out the consort checklist for clinical trials and include N\/A + justification for the criteria that you are not reporting because it’s a secondary analysis of a clinical trial and cite the main report where those features are described or 2) depending on your RQs\/analyses, use the STROBE checklist for observational studies or another checklist that fits better, without worrying that it’s a clinical trial. For example, this might work if you are analyzing data cross sectionally within the trial. Personally I think option 1 might be cleaner! ",
