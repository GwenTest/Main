As promised, I’m planning the next core team meeting more in advance. Here’s a poll for Dec 1-3, which I have worked out as a good meeting time based on a timeline of what we need to discuss before the end of the semester and what needs to happen before that. As we will be discussing some important topics (e.g. topics for the Winter semester, changes to the group format, roles and who will be fulfilling them), I hope many of you can make it, especially current organizers! If this period is really bad for you due to deadlines\/other tasks, please let me know asap, and I will try to work out a timeline that works better! If you can make it work, please fill out the poll *by Wednesday night*: <https:\/\/doodle.com\/poll\/qqqgefnxxeb7ztqp?utm_source=poll&amp;utm_medium=link>",

I wonder whether we absolutely need to set the topics for next semester before the dec 4 session? And rather we can ask participants at dec 4 which topics they would find interesting\/want us to cover and we can bring that info to the organizer meeting after everyone’s deadlines. I know we wanted to advertise to attendees but it might not be worth the push considering the time of year. "
