GitHub Actions are a method of continuous integration, which essentially means a cloud computer that you can tell to perform certain tasks within a GitHub repository using scripts. If you’re using it for run of the mill stuff it’s pretty easy to use because people have already created scripts that you can just throw in your repo without modifying.\n\nAnd then netlify is just a (free) static website hosting service. It’s also easy to use, especially with the workflow I have set up (you really just need to make an account, then take a couple extra steps, and then you never have to touch it again).\n\nBut everything I’m using here integrates together seamlessly so it might sound like a lot, but for the most part I can just do my writing in an R Markdown file and commit and push things to GitHub as I normally would. There isn’t really any extra overhead (except for the odd cases where a GitHub Actions build fails, but it’s usually easy to fix if you look at the error message).\n\nBut, I guess in general, since all this is based off working in R, there is the caveat that, until you build up a lexicon of functions and syntax, you will be slower at first. I’m happy to go over this with anyone over zoom though if this is a workflow they’d like to try",
