You make it, you own it (unless you’re making something for an employer, then usually the employer owns it, but that’s not relevant here). So if you don’t want anyone else using your creative work then you just leave it as is. You can throw a copyright statement on it too just to be clear about it.\n\n• Copyleft—that is, licensing others to use your copyrighted work in some capacity—is something you must explicitly declare. There are many copyleft licenses, drafted by lawyers, to serve a variety of needs and purposes. It is important to note that you do not give up your copyright when you license your work, you’re just allowing others to use that work without violating your copyright.\n\nDifferent licenses are appropriate for different things:\n• CC are for creative works such as art, writing, etc. <https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/|https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/>\n• MIT, GNU, and others are for software <https:\/\/choosealicense.com|https:\/\/choosealicense.com>\n\nIt’s important to pick the right license from the start, as in some cases you need to get consent from every user of your license if you want to change to a different license.\n\nIt’s also important to think about how you want others to be able to use your licensed work, e.g., some licenses allow others to profit off your work and use it in a business, whereas others just let people use your work personally.",
