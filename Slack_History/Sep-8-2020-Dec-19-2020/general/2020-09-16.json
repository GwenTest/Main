We are currently in the process of planning and designing our sessions for the semester and are seeking feedback on what you hope to learn and get from our sessions. Could you please make a *threaded response* to this post indicating what your interests for the sessions are? :smile:\n\nHere are some prompts:\n• Would you like lectures, discussions, workshops (or a mixture)?\n• What open science practices would you most like to learn? (e.g., publishing preprints, writing reproducible manuscripts in R, preregistration, etc.)\n\nOur first session will be an introduction to open science, but later sessions will likely be more focused on a single open science topic, so it will be helpful to know where your interests are!\n\nBest,\nMichael ",
