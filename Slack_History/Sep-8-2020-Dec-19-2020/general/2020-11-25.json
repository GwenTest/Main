We have not finalized a plan yet but depending on interest we are imagining that we will do some socializing and\/or play games over a virtual platform. Please fill out the Doodle poll below by *Monday December 7th* so we can find a time where most people are available! Also, feel free to suggest ideas for different activities\/games we could play. Thanks! <https:\/\/doodle.com\/poll\/ub9tgq2rxydm5yx3?utm_source=poll&amp;utm_medium=link>",
