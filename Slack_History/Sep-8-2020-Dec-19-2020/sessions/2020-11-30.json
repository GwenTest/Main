She will introduce herself and talk brielfy about how they got involved in open science, and then will provide overview of barriers and solutions she has tried (successfully and not) for each of the practices we talked about this semester. Then she will share examples of her own metascience research and experience creating her first registered report. She is happy to stick around for the duration of the session and will be paired with participants. I will send out the session agenda soon for your feedback.\n\nQuestion for both of you: Rosie will be sharing some anecdotes about difficult conversations she has had to have with supervisors. She is okay with us recording the session but she does not want it to be widely available to people outside of the group. I told her that we only share the recording with the group, we do not post it freely on OSF or anything like that. Can I confirm that this is actually the case? And if it is not, could we make an exception for this presentation?",
