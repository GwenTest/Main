It's basically a speaker series where students, faculty, and maybe guests from elsewhere can come talk about their work or practice presentations. I've emailed mostly faculty to ask them to talk with their trainees about it, but not everyone has time for that.\nIt might also be cool if someone could do an Open Science in Cognitive Psychology seminar :wink:",
