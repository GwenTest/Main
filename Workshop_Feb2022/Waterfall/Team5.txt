Story: Get schooled
This year school is a little bit snowy, but it’s ok because I still get to wear dresses and eat crackers after school. 
Even though last year I thought math was boring and geography was hard, this year I’m going to make sure I get really good at efficiency. 
If I don’t, I’m going to train my elephant to do my homework for me, just don’t tell Derek. If I were a teacher, 
I would want to teach Qualtitative Methods in Sociology and let everyone wear Earth hats all day. 
My friend would also be a teacher, and we would do draw on the sidewalk during our lunch break. 
But for now, since I’m a kid and not a teacher, I like to dance to Bank on it at lunch while standing on a desk. 
The best part of the school day is when I get to dancing and raise my hand to suggest eating. Honest, school is super cool.
